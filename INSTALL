Quick start
===========
Install Longene, you have 3 steps to go:
1. Build the patched Linux kernel
2. Build Wine-For-Longene, without wineserver
3. Build Longene module


Provides
========
A patch for linux-2.6.34 kernel
Wine-For-Longene source
Longene-0.3.1 module

Requirements
============
Linux-2.6.34 source

The current version (0.3.1) of Longene provides a patche for Linux kernel.

Make sure your system has installed the X11 development include files 
(called xlib6g-dev in Debian and XFree86-devel in Red Hat). 

Make sure your system has at least gcc 3.2 available which Linux kernel 2.6.34
requires.


Build Linux kernel
==================
To build Longene, the first thing is to patch the Linux kernel 2.6.34.
Cd to top-level directory of the kernel source code (linux-2.6.34),
and run the following command:

  patch -p1 < path/patchfile

where "patchfile" is "longene-0.3.1-linux-2.6.34.diff" and "path" is path
of the patchfile.

Both the kernel code and the general configuration (.config) are automatically
motified in this step.

After patching the kernel, configure it like:
  
  make menuconfig

The general configuration file (.config) is provided in the patch (you can also
configure it yourself), you can just save and exit to run the next 
commands:

  make
  make modules_install
  make install

Now you have a patched Linux kernel for Longene, then reboot your system to 
build the Longene module.

NOTE: If you decide to configure the patched kernel yourself, 
      the following settings are required:
      Need to change the version number.:
      General setup -> Local version  -> -longene-0.3.1
      
      Features tobe included:
      1. [*] General setup -> Longene support
      2. -*- General setup -> 
             Configure standard kernel features (for small systems) -> 
             Load all symbols for debugging/ksymoops
      3. [*] General setup -> 
             Configure standard kernel features (for small systems) -> 
             Do an extra kallsyms pass
      4. [*] General setup -> Disable heap randomization
      5. [*] File systems -> Native language support -> 
             Simplified Chinese charset (CP936, GB2312)

      Features tobe Excluded:
      1. [ ] Enable loadable module support -> 
             Module versioning support
      2. [ ] Processor type and features -> 
             Symmetric multi-processing support


Build Wine
==========
To build Wine, cd to the top-level directory of the Wine for Longene
source (wine-1.0-longene), then configure and build it:

  ./configure
  make depend
  make
  make install


Build Longene module
=================================
To build the module, you need to make sure you are using the patched
kernel you have built. Then, cd to the "module" directory and run 
the command:

  make

After building, install the module to get the Longene running:

  insmod unifiedkernel.ko

All done, Longene is running!


Run programs
================
Now you can run some Win32 programs in X terminal windows just like what 
you do on Linux, such as:

  ./Hellworld.exe

Note that Longene is not completed yet, so some applications may crash the
system or not work properly as on Microsoft Windows. You can report these
bugs on :

  http://www.longene.org/bugzilla


UNINSTALL
=========
If you don't want to use Longene any more, you can uninstall it:

1. Uninstall module:
  
  rmmod unifiedkernel.ko

cd to the directory "module" and run command:
  
  make clean

2. If you want, you can also unpatch Linux kernel:
cd to the top-level directory of the kernel source code, then run the 
command:

  patch -R -p1 < path/patchfile

as usual, where "path" is the path of the patch file and "patchfile" is 
its file name. 

And then, you can rebuild them.
